tex \section{Summary of results}

tex {\bf Analysis set 1.} \\[0.5cm]

tex Basic IRT model of cognitive tests in BLSA looks decent. The model includes a specific factor for the three CVLT items (alignment models cannot include this). Although raw loadings for CVLT appear higher than others (Figure), their standardized loadings are in line.\\[0.5cm]

tex {\bf Analysis set 2.} \\[0.5cm]

tex This is looking at DIF using items with up to 8 categories. There's no evidence of DIF by vision. There appears to be some DIF by hearing status, in u4 and u14 (TMT-B and animal fluency, both very weak) and u9 (DSST - DIF in all thresholds - harder for the impaired). The graph of loadings vs thresholds for hearing (section 3.8) does not show this in a spectacular fashion because the threshold differences are unstandardized and items cluster on top of each other. \\[0.5cm]

tex {\bf Analysis set 3.} \\[0.5cm]

tex This is looking at DIF using items with up to 5 categories. No evidence of DIF by visual impairment, which is consistent with analysis set 2. For hearing, there seems to be some DIF happening in the middle of TMT-B's thresholds, as in set 2. There is clear DIF in all thresholds of DSST (u9), as in analysis set 2, and in the same direction. Nothing for u14, animal fluency.\\[0.5cm]

tex {\bf Analysis set 4.} \\[0.5cm]

tex DIF in vision using only tests that are not vision-dependent. No evidence of DIF, although DSF (u1) is a remarkably horrid measure in the visually impaired group, as has been seen earlier in this report (but apparently not statistically so). When we look at DIF in hearing using only tests that are not hearing-dependent, there is no evidence of DIF. \\[0.5cm]

tex {\bf Analysis set 5.} \\[0.5cm]

tex Nothing pretty to report here, and a work in progress. But it does appear MIMIC models can replicate the DIF finding for u9 - DSST by hearing impairment status. \\[0.5cm]

tex {\bf Analysis set 6.} \\[0.5cm]

tex Here, we restrict to a common age range between the impaired and unimpaired groups. No evidence of vision DIF. There does appear to be hearing DIF in u9 (DSST) at the lowest 2 thresholds: among people with low cognition, hearing impaired people are disadvantaged. There's also some evidence in a middle threshold of U4 (TMT-B), which again I am not sure could be replicable.  \\[0.5cm]

tex {\bf Analysis set 7.} \\[0.5cm]

tex DIF by vision or hearing, among higher-educated group. We observe DIF by hearing in u9 (DSST) at the lowest threshold in the higher-educated group. \\[0.5cm]

tex {\bf Analysis set 8.} \\[0.5cm]

tex DIF by vision or hearing, among lower-educated group. The DIF results for vision are interesting here: there's DIF in the highest thresholds for u3 (TMT-A, more difficult for visually impaired), u11 (CVLT short delay, LESS difficult for visually impaired), u14 (Animal fluency, more difficult for visually impaired). In words, among those without the highest education in BLSA (aka educat 0,1,2,3), it is more difficult for visually impaired high performers to complete TMT-A and animal fluency, but easier for them to perform at the highest levels on CVLT short delay. There's nothing remarkable happening here in terms of hearing DIF. \\[0.5cm]

tex {\bf Analysis set 9.} \\[0.5cm]

tex DIF by vision or hearing, among women. Nothing for vision. There appears to be DIF by hearing impairment status among women in u9 (DSST) in the lowest 2 thresholds (e.g., among poorer performing women, the test is harder for the hearing impaired).  \\[0.5cm]

tex {\bf Analysis set 10.} \\[0.5cm]

tex DIF by vision or hearing, among men. For vision DIF, there appears to be vision DIF among men for u3 (TMT-A), u4 (TMT-B), u14 (animal fluency) at the highest thresholds: it is more difficult for visually impaired but high-cognition men to perform at the highest levels of these tests, compared to their ability to perform well on other tests. There's nothing remarkable happening here in terms of hearing DIF. \\[0.5cm]

tex {\bf Analysis set 11.} \\[0.5cm]

tex Among whites, there is vision DIF at the highest threshold of U3, TMT-A (more difficult for hearing impaired whites). As to hearing, there is DIF in u4 (TMT-B) and u9 (DSST) among whites; these tests are more difficult for hearing-impaired white respondents. \\[0.5cm]

tex {\bf Analysis set 12.} \\[0.5cm]

tex DIF by vision and hearing, among non-white participants. Evidence of vision DIF for u1 (DSF), u2 (DSB), u5 (card rotations), particularly in the highest thresholds. Sample size is so small here that I am not confident in this model; the loading for DSF is negative. There's nothing remarkable happening here in terms of hearing DIF. \\[0.5cm]
